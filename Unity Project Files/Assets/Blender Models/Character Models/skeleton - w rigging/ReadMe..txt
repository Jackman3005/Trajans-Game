Fully Rigged Skeleton

Includes eye and jaw rig combined with the default Rigify-rig. It comes with the beginnings of a pose library, which includes the default rest pose for the complete rig + seperate rest poses for the eyes and the jaw. It also has the gladiator pose used in the render + a seperate pose for the sword hand fingers.

Based on the easter egg found in the Makehunan 0.91 RC collada export. In addition to being fully rigged, it has been heavily edited to increase the definition of the bones. The coxis has been replaced along with the skull, jaw and teeth. Crazy psychadelic eyes have also been added. 

The sword and sheild used in the demo render were downloaded a couple of years ago from the "Blender 3D model repository" and are not included in the blend. 

The sand texture, also not included was downloaded from deviant art and is by user "hhh316"

I put a lot of work into getting this right and If you want to give credit use "Irvine from Blender Artists,"

PS
It is my first attempt at modelling something as complex and feedback would be appreciated.
